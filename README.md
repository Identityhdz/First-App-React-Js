## Installation

Amazon books requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Fix Error: **"This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above"** Delete your package-lock.json file and node_modules folder. Then do npm cache clean

```sh
npm cache clean --force
```

Do:
```sh
npm install
```

Again:
```sh
npm start
```
